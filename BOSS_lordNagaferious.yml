# ============================================================================================
# This is going to be the most intricate boss script to date.
# 
# NOTES:
# Teleport Location for Nagaferious encounter:
# /teleport 10000 151 10000 world_the_end

# ============================================================================================
#
# Encounter Details
# 3 Phase fight.
#
# ============================================================================================
#
# Phase 1 : 100% - 90%
# ====================
# Boss flies in circles around the room in dragon form.
# Adds from each of the four corridors will charge the main room.
# Adds consist of zombie mobs (regular zombies) with full diamond armor.
# The boss will spawn 4 adds (one in each corridor) every 5 seconds.
# Once 200 adds are slain, the boss will land and initiate phase 2.
#
# Abilities:
# ====================
#   Summon Adds:
#       5s CD
#       Summon one zombie add with diamond armor in each corridor of the room.
#   Meteor:
#       2s CD
#       Boss fires a meteor at a random player (Fireball, similar to Balthazar).
#   Pylon Ignite:
#       10s CD
#       Boss activates one of the four pylons. Players have 10s to deactivate
#       the pylon by stepping on the yellow squares found in front of them.
#       This will remove a flag from the NPC. If the flag is still active
#       by the time the next Pylon Ingite fires off, the raid will take
#       25 damage each (Hurt 25). 
#   
# ============================================================================================
#
# Phase 2 : 89% - 40%
# ====================
# Boss lands (still in dragon form). Boss has no primary melee attack, but has lots 
# of exciting ranged attacks. The dragon has a fire breath (fontal cone), and a tail
# swipe (reverse frontal cone). Boss also shoots fireballs at players. Boss also
# 'digests' players, as well as activate the pylons in this phase. 
# Boss also does AE fire burn (kinda like the fire breath, but hits the whole room).
# This flags players as having "Burning Skin", requiring them to walk on the 
# glass reverse of the yellow glass (opposite side of pylons).
#
# Abilities:
# ====================
#   Dragon Breath:
#       20s CD
#       Frontal AE Fire damage (Hits for 25 damage). Burns targets for 10 seconds.
#       Grab all blocks in front of Boss' direction of view and apply this ability.
#   Tail Swipe:
#       0s CD
#       Grab all blocks behidn the boss' direction of view and apply this ability.
#       Hits player for 15 damage (harm).
#   Dragon Fire:
#       2s CD
#       Targets a random player and shoots a fireball at them, as well as harming
#       them for 5 damage.
#   Digest:
#       30s CD
#       A random player is 'digested' and teleported to the 'stomach' room of the
#       dragon. Players then find an NPC called 'Weak Spot'. Players must hit
#       this NPC 5 times (NPC heals every time it is hit, so it cannot be killed)
#       Upon hitting the NPC 5 times, the player will be flagged as hitting it 5 
#       times and successfully teleport 'out' of the dragon's stomach, and 
#       arrives directly under the boss.
#   Pylon Ignite:
#       10s CD
#       Boss activates one of the four pylons. Players have 10s to deactivate
#       the pylon by stepping on the yellow squares found in front of them.
#       This will remove a flag from the NPC. If the flag is still active
#       by the time the next Pylon Ingite fires off, the raid will take
#       25 damage each (Hurt 25). 
#   Flamewave:
#       60s CD
#       Boss ignites all players flagged as having agro on him (including those
#       in the stomach at the moment) and harms them for 5 damage. These players
#       are then flagged as being on the boss' "Flamewave" list. These players must
#       run to the opposite side of the Pylon to remove their "Burning Skin" affect.
#       Otherwise, these players will take 5 damage every second from the boss 
#       as part of his on-damage protocol. Players can avoid harming the raid if 
#       everyone stops attacking until all the debuffs are cleared from every player.
#
# ============================================================================================
#
# Phase 3 : 39% - 0%
# ====================
# In this phase, the boss INHERITS ALL OF ITS ABILITIES FROM PHASE 2, in addition
# to the new abilities outlined below. The boss now has the ability to resurrect
# his zombie adds (50 at once) every 45 seconds. The boss will also randomly empower 
# one player in the raid, while making the rest weakened. This suggests the empowered 
# player should run over to the boss and begin attacking, since they will
# have a superior strength buff, while the rest of the raid should focus on add control
# and supporting the empowered player, since they will be weakened and not deal as much
# damage. Empower fires off every 45 seconds and then buff lasts for 20 seconds.
#
# Abilities:
# ====================
#   ALL ABILITIES FROM PHASE 2 AND:
#   Call of the Grave:
#       45s CD
#       Boss revives 50 zombie adds from phase one (aka summons 50 adds) at his feet.
#       Players must then either kite or defeat these adds before more are summoned.
#   Empower:
#       45s CD
#       Boss 'empowers' one target of the raid group (You there, show me what you got!)
#       This player is flagged with a Strength V buff that lasts for 20 seconds, while
#       everyone else in the raid is flaggedd with a Weakness I buff that lasts for 20
#       seconds. The idea is the empowered player handles the boss while the weakened
#       players handle adds and/or support roles for the player attacking the boss.
