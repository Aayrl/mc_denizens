#
# Encounter Details
# 3 Phase fight.
# 
# Phase 1 : 100% - 90%
# Boss flies in circles around the room in dragon form.
# Adds from each of the four corridors will charge the main room.
# Adds consist of zombie mobs (regular zombies) with full diamond armor.
# The boss will spawn 4 adds (one in each corridor) every 5 seconds.
# Once 200 adds are slain, the boss will land and initiate phase 2.
# Abilities:
#   Summon Adds:
#       5s CD
#       Summon one zombie add with diamond armor in each corridor of the room.
#   Meteor:
#       10s CD
#       Boss fires a meteor at a random player (Fireball, similar to Balthazar).
#   Pylon Ignite:
#       10s CD
#       Boss activates one of the four pylons. Players have 10s to deactivate
#       the pylon by stepping on the yellow squares found in front of them.
#       This will remove a flag from the NPC. If the flag is still active
#       by the time the next Pylon Ingite fires off, the raid will take
#       25 damage each (Hurt 25).
