# Blacksmith Script
# ----------------
#
# The Blacksmith Script allows administrators to assign NPCs the role of
# blacksmith. NOTE: This is not the same as the citizens2 trait 'blacksmith'
# 
# To use: Place the desired item in your hand and right click on the NPC.
# The NPC will then determine how many credits it will cost for you to repair
# that item, and will the prompt you to confirm in chat that you wish to
# repair the item. Upon confirmation, the script will deduct the desired
# amount of credits from the player's wallet and repair the item in their
# hand to full.
