# Handling for the Creative world.
# Set player gamemode on entry, and removes on exit
# as well as removing their inventory on exit.
#
# Concept:
# If player changes world to w@creative, flag them for
# being able to change gamemode, and then change them to creative.
# Remove the flag after the change is done.
# If the player leaves w@creative, add this flag, change their gamemode to 0,
# remove this flag, and then remove all items in their inventory.
