# Credits Currency
# ----------------
#
# A custom Denizen-based economy scripting protocol that allows players to
# buy, sell, and trade items to NPCs designated as the 'vendor' assignment.
#
# Item buy/sell values can be customized in the appropriate NPC assignment 
# script. 
#
# NPCs can be customized to require a certain faction in order to speak to
# a particular player.
#
# NPCs may also be assigned the 'Auction' assignment to allow players to 
# sell unique or custom items obtained through the server (such as custom 
# boss loot) to other players for credits.
#
# Credits may be used to buy (almost) all items in the game.
#
# Players can also transfer credits to one another in trade for 
# specific items using the /credit transfer amt player command.
#
# See the individual commands below for comments and details.
